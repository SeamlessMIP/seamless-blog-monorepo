            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Our founding members met through an act of serendipity. One was a business consultant in corporate America who required an organ to be removed due to illness and had seen many doctors trying to save his organ. The other was (and still is) an interventional radiologist who delivered organ-saving treatment. They met through a chance encounter, as no physician had provided this organ-saving treatment as an option. After successful treatment, they decided to team up together and bring minimally invasive procedures to as many people as possible, focusing on high quality care with better outcomes compared to traditional surgery. We hope our story can become your story as well.
